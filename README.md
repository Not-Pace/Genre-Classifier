# Genre Classification using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Being audiophiles, we've always been interested in the kind of effect the 'reading' of music has on its style, and whether there's a quantitative aspect to any tangible reading of music. Thus, we began this project with the thought of understanding how music genres came to be, and whether a stylistic choice can be quantified into a set of features on an image.

## Dataset

For this project, we used the [GTZAN Music Genre Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification). The dataset took the age old GTZAN dataset from 2002 and extended upon it by adding an extracted set of important features in a CSV file, as well as images of the mel-spectrograms of all the audio files, thus making it 3 different datasets for the same purpose. We tried to explore all 3 for the models we made.
